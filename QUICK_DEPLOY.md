## 📞 Quick Troubleshooting

**App shows "API key error"**  
→ Double-check the API key in Streamlit secrets (Step 4)

**App is slow or timing out**  
→ Free tier has limits. Consider analyzing fewer parts at once.

**Can't push to GitHub**  
→ Make sure you created the repository on GitHub first

**App won't start**  
→ Check Streamlit Cloud logs (click "Manage app" → "Logs")

---

## 🔄 Updating Your App

Make changes locally, then:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push origin main
```

Streamlit automatically redeploys in ~1 minute!
